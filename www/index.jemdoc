== About me

~~~
I am an Assistant Professor of School of Computing and Information Sciences (SCIS). I received my second Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [https://www.umass.edu/ UMass Amherst] in 2018 under the supervision of Professor [http://www.ecs.umass.edu/~irwin/index.html David Irwin]. Before that, I finished my first Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2014 from [http://english.neu.edu.cn/ Northeastern University] China where I was advised by Professor Guiran Chang. I also worked in industry for two years. At FIU SCIS, I lead the [https://cps.cis.fiu.edu/ Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory (CPSLab)].
